 => starting up with (CSS)

 before starting with css we need to link the css file with the html file
 after that we make a boiler plate like we have in html .

 *{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
 }
 html,body{
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
 }

 // properties related to text :
 color: this property is used to change the color of the text
 background-color: this property is used to change the background color of the element
 font-size: this property is used to change the size of the text
 font-family: this property is used to change the font of the text
 font-weight: this property is used to change the weight of the text ( thickness of the text.)


 // some comcepts related to div :
  div : as told it is a container or a box so we can give it a height and width 
  // for shifting it we can use margin and padding
  margin : this property is used to create space outside the element
  pading : this property is used to create space inside the element
   like simply margin works in the whole page and padding woks in the box 

// but if we want to make it into conter of the page we can use position-absolute;
  position: absolute; 
  top: 50%; 
  left: 50%; 
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);

  it will make it in centre but rember it not work if we have not given the height and width of the div 
  and the most important it it flw the box up.

  // now we will learn some concpepts related to dix alignment 
  : for example we have a manin  div and in it we have 3 more divs so after that the div me align by thmselve 
  by using display: flex; it will make the divs align in a row

  then we use align-items: center; it will make the divs align in the center of the main div 
but it works in y axis so we use justify-content: center; it will will help us to aling it in 
y axis  also we cn use some other properties like justify-content: flex-start; 
  justify-content: flex-end; 
  justify-content: space-between; 
  justify-content: space-around; 
  justify-content: space-evenly;


line-height: this property is used to change the line height of the text
// text-align: this property is used to change the alignment of the text
// text-decoration: this property is used to add decoration to the text like underline, overline, line-through
// text-transform: this property is used to change the case of the text like uppercase, lowercase, capitalize
// letter-spacing: this property is used to change the spacing between the letters
// word-spacing: this property is used to change the spacing between the words

// font-variant: this property is used to change the variant of the text like small-caps, all-small-caps, petite-caps, all-petite-caps, unicase, titling-caps

position: this property is used to change the position of the element like static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky
// static: this is the default value, the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document
// relative: the element is positioned relative to its normal position
// absolute: the element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor
// fixed: the element is positioned relative to the viewport, it will not move when the page is scrolled
